Euros Predictor Application. 

This project has been designed and implemented my myself and is not part of a course like some of my other repos. The functionality has been working since the June 14th deadline and the CSS and visual design have been worked during the euros. 

Using HTML, React, API's and SASS to create a website that took predictions from a player, stored them in a database and then worked out the scoring for each player after each game day.
Results given in ordered tables. Also displays todays precidtions for each player and the scores from the game day before.

Between 14th and 26th of June the page will be active, after groups stages will be in demo mode. If you would like to see the predictions page during active play, let me know and I can activate it.
